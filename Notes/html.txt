<img> image element, no closing tag (empty)
 <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="description txt">
 use <im src="../<image path>> to step up to the parent directory 

 image types:
 jpg = great for photos, can handle large color palettes w/o much size
 gif = great for simple animations 
 png = great for anything not photo or animation (icons, logos, diagrams)
 svg = vector based, can scale to any dimension without loss of quality
        - same usecase as png, except maybe not great if lots of text
